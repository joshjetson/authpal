# AuthPal> A Program to save and manage all of your usernames and passwords

**NOTE: 
          <b>Linux Users:</b>
          Make sure all of the files are in the same folder then in a terminal simply chmod +x authpal then ./authpal to run the program.
          <b>Windows Users:</b>
          Keep all of the files in authpal_win together then just double click on the executable.
          
          
          If you ever want to start from scratch just delete the db files that are generated in the folder after 
          a new login is created. This program does not use any network protocols you can verify it yourself by checking
          your network. Make sure to remember the login username and password, which if you end up liking the program,
          will be the most important username and password you need to store and rememebr but one is better then dozens.
          
          
          
  I made this program because I got tired of putting all of my usernames and passwords in text-editors. 
  and I noticed that everything similar to this program you had to pay for. Pay for such a simple task I thought...no no.
  Thus this simple program was created using tkinter and python. Tkinter is ugly I know I know. If people end up using this thing
  I will modify it so it is better and im open to suggestions. Hope smoeone finds use for it. Cheers!
